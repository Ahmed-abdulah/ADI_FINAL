#### some points to understand vectoring cordic

- I have used the recommended architecture by Karim Abbas
- I have used also the accomplished example as a testbensh
- The architecure is piplined
- __INputs__ is simply two variables which are needed to be nulled in one variable (vector to be projected onto one dimension)
- __OUTPUTS__ is the projected new value(because vector is scaled by some factor) and **angle of rotation**

- I have used fixed point simulation technique to represent floating points 
- The forma I have used is 
  1 : `for sign`
                            4 : `integer `
                            11: `decimal fraction`

                  
              PLEASE REVIEW IT AND ITS VALIDTY BECAUSE IT'S A BUILDING BLOCK AND FEEL FREE TO RECOMMEND EDITION
